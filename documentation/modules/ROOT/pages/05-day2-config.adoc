= Day 2

At this point you have a cluster with an argo instance deployed and cluster admin permissions managed by an argo hub. So you can start configuring day 2 operations.

As we might need to apply this configuration to multiple managed clusters, we need to be able to render multiple applications using helm charts, even though we are applying this configuration
to our single scoped cluster.

For this [repository] and checkout to your working branch.

----
git branch # main
git checkout -b sno-<name>      
----  

Take a look to the code, this repo renders Applications by applying a source code, importing and overriding values for each chart so you are not expected to modify those charts
but their values.

You can take a look to the charts https://github.com/romerobu/workshop-gitops-apps-deploy.git[here].

You must override values.yaml with your cluster data, and then render the application to be deployed on your managed cluster:

----
helm template . --output-dir application-sno    
---- 

If you try to deploy this Application on your cluster you will it syncs, but it does not render objects as every value is disabled.
