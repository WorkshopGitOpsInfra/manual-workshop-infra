= Helm charts

First Helm chart is *gitops-setup*, which deploys GitOps operator on managed clusters. This chart is intented to deploy any kind of operator, even though in this case we are
only deploying GitOps operator.

If you navigate to subscription.yaml resource you will see there is a global value for applying env variables for GitOps. 

These config values disable the default argocd instance and enables a new instance to be cluster wide. This means this argo application controller sa will have
permissions to work in all namespaces within the cluster.

By default any new instance created is namespace scoped, this means you will only be allowed to deploy within your namespace. If you want to deploy across all namespace
you need to change this configuration to make the instance cluster wide. Additionally your argo sa may not have privileges enough to work with cluster wide resources and you might need to 
assign a new role binding for it.

You can either create a custom role binding or labelling any managed namespace by argo so it will create this role binding automatically only for that namespace.

After setting this global var you can see a new cluster role binding for this sa and this configuration on argocd console.

You can take a look to global env vars https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/03/06/5-global-environment-variables-provided-openshift-gitops#5_environment_variables__overview[here], how to label namespaces https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/gitops/setting-up-argocd-instance.html#gitops-deploy-resources-different-namespaces_setting-up-argocd-instance[here] 
and how to create a role binding https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/gitops/configuring-an-openshift-cluster-by-deploying-an-application-with-cluster-configurations.html#gitops-additional-permissions-for-cluster-config_configuring-an-openshift-cluster-by-deploying-an-application-with-cluster-configurations[here].

Once the operator is running, we need to deploy ArgoCD instance. To make sure instance is deployed after the operator is running we use sync waves and custom resources healthcheck.

Sync waves are defined on each resource as annotations, and they tell argo the order in which resources should be applied once the previous is already in healthy status.
You can take a look in detail to the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/[documentation].

For some specific resources they need a custom healthcheck. Most of the objects only require existing to work but others like subscription may exists but not progress to a successful status so we
need a https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/[custom healthcheck] to make sure the next sync wave does not start till the operators are properly installed.

Resource healthcheck is defined in the argo instace, which is also deployed using helm charts.

Navigate to ArgoCD instance and take a look to the *resourceCustomizations* section, as well as other configurations that we will review later on.

1. Dex uses groups and users defined within Openshift by checking the Oauth server

2. Overrides default tracking method by label to annotation+label

3. Enable ApplicationSet controller

4. Configure argo RBAC

5. Configure vault plugin as a sidecar container

6. Configure new plugin for vault

7. Configure resource healthcheck for Subscription

As you may notice this instance contains some parametes for configuring vault plugin (which we will discuss later) and rbac model.

Rbac is defined on *rbac* folder and includes the basic configuration for argo RBAC and projects.

The https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/[RBAC] feature enables restriction of access to Argo CD resources. Argo CD does not have its own user management system and has only one built-in user admin. 
The admin user is a superuser and it has unrestricted access to the system. RBAC requires SSO configuration or one or more local users setup. 
Once SSO or local users are configured, additional RBAC roles can be defined, and SSO groups or local users can then be mapped to roles.

Argo CD has two pre-defined roles but RBAC configuration allows defining roles and groups (see below).

- role:readonly - read-only access to all resources

- role:admin - unrestricted access to all resources

Additionally to the defined roles, it is possible to create some specific roles to allow argo-operators and argo-dev-operators group members manage applications in Argo CD.

Then if you navigate to rbac folder you can see a Group and a Role binding resource to give cluster-admin permissions on argo to the admin user configured via Htpasswd.

For RBAC we need to differentiate between global configuration on argocd intance and projects RBAC.

If you navigate to rbac section on argo instance, you will see some rbac policies starting like *g*  and *p*.

Policies starting with g assign roles to openshift local groups (they can be both argo roles and ocp roles) and their users, while policies starting with p define specific policies for projects, resources, projects and applications and their operations.

The following sections collect the information around Argo CD Roles and Argo CD permission in the managed clusters. It is important to understand the functionality matrix and permission that the following sections try to implement:

- argo-admins: group members have full permissions in Argo CD to admin

- argo-readers: group members have read-only permissions in Argo CD to access all information

- argo-operators: group members have permission to manage applications (get and sync) only in Argo CD

- argo-dev-operators: group members have permission to manage applications (get and sync) only in Argo CD dev project

- apimanager01: user has no permissions to see anything in Argo CD but has permissions to create objects in the Openshift Clusters

Then on AppProject we can define restrictions like source repo, destination servers and resource whitelist allowed per project. Moreover you can define local roles for that AppProject.

Last but not least are *namespaces*. Namespaces are created as part of the bootstrap process by the argo infra instance so the operator in charge of managing apps lifecycle does not 
need to have cluster wide privileges. (Add link to some article about namespaces management)

Finally push your changes to your working branch, login to argo hub cluster with user-<name> and deploy the bootstrap Application.

To create bootstrap application, navigate to Argo console, click on **New app**, then **Edit as Yaml**, **save** and finally **Create**.

At this point you should see some applications on syncing on your argo console. You cannot see your colleagues deployments thanks to RBAC.

image::managed-setup.png[]

Deep dive on *managed-setup-a-<name>* to check all the resources created. Next go back to the initial view and see how the Applications rendered by ApplicationSet are created.

image::managed-setup-a-name.png[]

Then navigate to argo hub console using your user with view role, navigate to ArgoCD instance (Installed Operators -> Openshift GitOps -> ArgoCD), take a look to global rbac policies and then navigate to your AppProject
to verify yor local permissions.

If you try to deploy a new Application from the console you will see you cannot deploy to a different cluster destination than yours.

image::clusters-list.png[]

It happens the same with projects, you can only see yours:

image::projects-list.png[]

Once this is completed login to you managed cluster, and verify:

- GitOps operator is installed.

- Argo-infra instance exists and is cluster wide .

image::cluster-wide.png[]

- Argo-apps instance exists and isn't cluster wide .

- Existing Dev and Pro AppProject on argocd-apps instance.

- Login as admin user and verify you can create apps on dev project (argocd-apps).
