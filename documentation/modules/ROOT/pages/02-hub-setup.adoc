= Argo hub setup
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== Lab overview

In this lab we are covering a GitOps infrastructure configuration approach. 
We will set an argo of argos and app of apps architecture to manage setup on destination clusters, and will apply day 2 operations on managed clusters.

This is the general overview of the lab. You will be able to connect to both argo-hub and managed clusters, and day 2 operations will setup based on gitops instance running on managed cluster.

First of all, when you install GitOps operator, it will deploy a default argo instance which is intended for cluster configuration. So in this instance you will find an Application hub-setup
which is deploying and managing a second argocd instance and its configuration.

Then as an user lab, you will access to the second argo instance where you will have privileges enough thanks to RBAC configuration to deploy an Application for applying ApplicationSets to apply configuration on your managed cluster.
Gitops-setup ApplicationSet will install the operator and the argocd-infra instance, while the second one will generate N Applications on managed clusters for bootrstrapping the argocd-apps instance and setup its configuration.

Once GitOps is deployed on your managed cluster you can start configuring day 2 operations locally in your new provisioned argo instace.

== Enviroment

You have access to two clusters, *argo-hub* and your own *https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/meet-single-node-openshift-our-smallest-openshift-footprint-edge-architectures[single node]* (managed). You can login to argo-hub using *user-<name>* and to sno using *admin* user.
On top of that, if you login to argo console using your Openshift user, you will only have permissions over your project and destination cluster.

The reason why argo hub has permissions over your managed cluster is because this is configured as a destination server, given an authentication method.

In argo hub there is a secret in argo namespace for every managed cluster containing this information. There are several ways to implement this, you can generate an 
authentication token for this purpose or you can pass kubeconfig file to give full control over the destination cluster.

== Hub setup

Argo hub is a common cluster for every user in this workshop that will be used for deploying the basic infrastructure on managed clusters using ApplicationSet.
In this cluster you can find two argo instances, openshift-gitops (default) and argocd. Default instance is intended to manage the hub itself, and it is in charge of
deploying the argocd instance and its configuration. While argocd is dedicated for managed clusters setup and configuration.

As argo hub setup should be done only once before this lab, you can login to openshift-gitops argo console with view permissions to take a look to the objects
argo is managing for deploying the second instance.

Then you can go to the code to take a look to the helm charts used. Fork this https://github.com/romerobu/workshop-gitops-content-deploy[repository] to start diving into the code.

First take a look to the helm charts used for argo hub setup and then navigate to the console. As this configuration is already deployed you don't need to make any change, only observe the way it was done.

Navigate to global-config/bootstrap-a/hub-setup-a.yaml application and see how this sets up env config on in-cluster (https://kubernetes.default.svc):

    path: hub-setup/charts/gitops-setup 
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true

Then go to openshift-gitops console and take a look to the objects managed by argo. As you can see, using range of values while rendering charts allows to create charts for
multiple destinations without much complexity.

For this initial setup it is only required to create argocd instance, app projects, groups and role bindings and secrets for cluster destinations.

Then once this second instance is up and running, you can login with your user-<name> to argo console as admin user of your own project while you will only have cluster reader permissions when you login to Openshift console.

By using this instance you will be able to setup your own managed cluster.

Ideally you could set up every managed with a single ApplicationSet by configuring multiple cluster-definition. However because of the workshop structure you need to perform cluster scoped configurations without affecting other users, but your repository could be easily adapted to perform actions on multiple clusters.
