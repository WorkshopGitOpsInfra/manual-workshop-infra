PENDING: Add diagrams and introduction

== Enviroment

You have access to two clusters, *argo-hub* and your own *single node* (managed). You can login to argo-hub using *user-<name>* and to sno using *admin* user.
On top of that, if you login to argo console using your Openshift user, you will only have permissions over your project and destination cluster.

The reason why argo hub has permissions over your managed cluster is because this is configured as a destination server, given an authentication method.

In argo hub there is a secret on argo namespace for every managed cluster containing this information. There are several ways to implement this, you can generate an 
authentication token for this purpose or you can pass kubeconfig file to five full control over the destination cluster.

== Hub setup

Argo hub is a common cluster for every user in this workshop that will be used for deploying the basic infrastructure on managed clusters using ApplicationSet.
You can login with your user-<name> to argo console as admin user of your own project while you will only have cluster reader permissions when you login to Openshift console.

Ideally you could simoultaneusly deploy argo hub and managed clusters configuration as you can use a single bootstrap Application to deploy both applications for argo hub and managed clusters, and then render N Applications
for managed clusters using ApplicationSet. However because of the workshop structure you need to perform cluster scoped configurations without affecting other users, but your repository could be easily adapted to perform actions on multiple clusters.

Fork this https://github.com/romerobu/workshop-gitops-content-deploy[repository] to start diving into the code.

First take a look to the helm charts used for argo hub setup and then navigate to the console. As this configuration is already deployed you don't need to make any change, only observe the way it was done.

Navigate to gitops-config-as/hub-setup-a.yaml application and see how this sets up env config on in-cluster (https://kubernetes.default.svc).
If you navigate to argo console you won't be able to see this Application because of the RBAC configuration (you don't have permissions on default project) but if you navigate to Openshift Console on Explore API section
you will see the resource created:

Then navigate to the source repo on Github to take a look to the helm charts used and the configuration applied.
